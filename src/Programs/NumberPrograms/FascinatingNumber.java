Multiplying a number by two and three separately, the number obtained by writing the results obtained with the given number will be called a fascinating number.
If the result obtained after concatenation contains all digits from 1 to 9, exactly once.

In other words, we can also say that a number (n) may be a fascinating number if it satisfies the following two conditions:

    If the given number is a 3 or more than three-digit

    If the value getting after concatenation contains all digits from 1 to 9, exactly once.
