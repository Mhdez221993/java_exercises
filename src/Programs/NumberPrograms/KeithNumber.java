/*
A positive n digit number X is called a Keith number (or repfigit number) if it is arranged in a special number sequence generated using its digits.
The special sequence has first n terms as digits of x and other terms are recursively evaluated as the sum of previous n terms.
For example, 197, 19, 742, 1537, etc.

Steps to Find Keith Number

    Read or initialize a number (X).

    Separate each digit from the given number (X).

    Add all the n-digits. It gives the next term of the series.

    Again, add the last n-terms of the series to find the next term.

    Repeat step 4 until we get the term the same as the number we have taken.
